# Braggin-Rights

Please note that this readme assumes knowledge of git.

1. Git Clone the project and save it onto your desktop.

2. Open the back end folder in IntelliJ IDEA CE and get it running. 

To do this navigate to... src > main > java > com.codeclan > BragginRightsApplication
Now run public static void main by clicking on the green arrow to the left of the code. 

This will run the back end and you should see Spring booting into action, at the bottom in amoung all the messeges is shoudl say TOMCAT somewhere!

Now the backend is running, time to get the front end setup.

3. Navigate to the front end folder in terminal. 

4. Run a NPM install, this should find your package json and install all the dependencies.  Please note you must be in the front end folder for this to work, not the root directory.

5. Once these are installed go back to terminal and type in 'npm start', again in the front end folder.  This should bring up a window in your browser on Localhost:3000.

Now the web app should be up and running!
